Statistical errors of 1 and 2 kind, calculating probabilities. 
In this programm we try to find probabilities statistical errors of 1 and 2 kind or probabilities of event H1, which is more or less then
H0.
In this version we need change value of variables in code, and write at start programm - what kind of mode we want to find. 
(The solution of the test problem was required for specific data)
For statistical errors we will find probabilities of summary errors and graph of this errors. 
For probabilities of event we will find probabilities of event and graph of probabilities.
The program presents a graph after the completed Z transformations. 
Programm use the normal distribution function.
